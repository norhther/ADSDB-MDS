```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(tidymodels)
df <- read_csv("data/first_removal.csv")
```

```{r}
sapply(df, function(x) sum(is.na(x))/nrow(df))
```
As finalIq is the variable that we want to predict, we can not impute it.
So we are going to remove these na values, 16% of the total observations, however, we 
have half a million records.


```{r}
df <- df %>%
  filter(!is.na(finalIq))
sapply(df, function(x) sum(is.na(x))/nrow(df))

```

```{r}
preprocess_recipe <- recipe(~., data = df) %>%
  step_impute_knn(mother_educ, father_educ, gender, internet, math, read, science, stu_wgt, desk,
                  room, television, computer_n, car, book, wealth, escs,
                  neighbors = floor(sqrt(ncol(df))))

preprocess_rec_prep <- prep(preprocess_recipe, df)

juice(preprocess_rec_prep) %>%
  write_csv("data/imputed.csv")
```

Apply a knn with k = sqrt(n_obs) -> good practical results!
